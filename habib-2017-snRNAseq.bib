	abstract = {Normalization of single-cell RNA sequencing data is necessary to eliminate cell-specific biases prior to downstream analyses. However, this is not straightforward for noisy single-cell data where many counts are zero. We present a novel approach where expression values are summed across pools of cells, and the summed values are used for normalization. Pool-based size factors are then deconvolved to yield cell-based factors. Our deconvolution approach outperforms existing methods for accurate normalization of cell-specific biases in simulated data. Similar behavior is observed in real data, where deconvolution improves the relevance of results of downstream analyses.},

	abstract = {Principal component analysis (PCA) is an essential method for analyzing single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) dataset but for large-scale scRNA-seq datasets, the computation consumes a long time and large memory space. In this work, we review the existing fast and memory-eﬃcient PCA algorithms and implementations and evaluate their practical application to large-scale scRNA-seq dataset. Our benchmark showed that some PCA algorithms based on Krylov subspace and randomized singular value decomposition are fast, memory-eﬃcient, and accurate than the other algorithms. Considering the diﬀerence of computational environment of users and developers, we also developed the guideline to select the appropriate PCA implementations.},
